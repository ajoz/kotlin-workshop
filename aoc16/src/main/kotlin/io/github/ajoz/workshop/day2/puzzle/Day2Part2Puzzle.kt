/**
 * You finally arrive at the bathroom (it's a several minute walk from the lobby so visitors can behold the many fancy
 * conference rooms and water coolers on this floor) and go to punch in the code. Much to your bladder's dismay, the
 * keypad is not at all like you imagined it. Instead, you are confronted after the result of hundreds of man-hours of
 * bathroom-keypad-design meetings:
 *
 *     1
 *   2 3 4
 * 5 6 7 8 9
 *   A B C
 *     D
 * You still start at "5" and stop when you're at an edge, but given the same instructions as above, the outcome is very
 * different:
 *
 * - You start at "5" and don't move at all (up and left are both edges), ending at 5.
 * - Continuing from "5", you move right twice and down three times (through "6", "7", "B", "D", "D"), ending at D.
 * - Then, from "D", you move five more times (through "D", "B", "C", "C", "B"), ending at B.
 * - Finally, after five more moves, you end at 3.
 *
 * So, given the actual keypad layout, the code would be 5DB3.

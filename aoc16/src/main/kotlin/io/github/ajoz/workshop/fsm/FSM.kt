/**
 * Simple example of a immutable finite state machine. There are few issues with this naive implementation:
 * - we do not guarantee that the set of possible states is finite due to State<T>
 * - we do not check if the set of possible state is not empty
 * - we do not guarantee that the set of possible symbols in the FSM alphabet is finite due to Symbol<V>
 * - we do not check if the set of possible symbols is not empty
 * - we do not explicitly define a set of final states
 *
 * Maybe "few" is a misuse of the word :P Nonetheless this trivial implementation shows an immutable approach

/**
 * Day 1: No Time for a Taxicab
 *
 * You're airdropped near Easter Bunny Headquarters in a city somewhere. "Near", unfortunately, is as close as you can get
 * - the instructions on the Easter Bunny Recruiting Document the Elves intercepted start here, and nobody had time to work
 * them out further.
 *
 * The Document indicates that you should start at the given coordinates (where you just landed) and face North. Then,
 * follow the provided sequence: either turn left (L) or right (R) 90 degrees, then walk forward the given number of
 * blocks, ending at a new intersection.
 *
 * There's no time to follow such ridiculous instructions on foot, though, so you take a moment and work out the
 * destination. Given that you can only walk on the street grid of the city, how far is the shortest path to the
 * destination?
